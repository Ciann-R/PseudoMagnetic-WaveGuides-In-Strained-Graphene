## Abstract:

"Efficacious electron confinement and wave-guiding is pertinent to the further development of nano-scale technological devices.
In recent times, novel fields such as straintronics has emerged in an endeavour to exploit the electronic transport regimes of
effectively two-dimensional materials. In light of this, Graphene presents itself as an effectively two-dimensional, hexagonally
shaped molecular allotrope of Carbon with exceedingly unique electronic properties. These unique properties have invoked a
paradigm shift in fundamental physics, providing for a virtual coupling of condensed-matter physics and quantum electrodynamics.
The emergence of quasi-relativistic fermions within the vicinity of the Fermi level provides for the basis of expressing grapheneâ€™s
energy states in the form of a Dirac-like Hamiltonian. This remarkable deduction is realised through the conventional Nearest Neighbour-Tight-Binding (NNTB) formulation of graphene. In context of the application of geometric lattice strain, both
conceptualisations prove fruitful in the extraction of novel electronic properties. In particular, the discussion throughout
revolves primarily around inhomogeneous out-of-plane lattice strain modeled by several Gaussian functions. On one hand,
as a consequence of strain, the continuum Dirac formalism predicts the emergence of pseudo-gauge (PGF), pseudo-magnetic
fields (PMF) and scalar field potentials from the spatial dependency of the strain modulated hopping integral, whilst on the
other hand, the NNTB formalism provides for the description of the strain modulated electronic transport properties within the
system. The emergent strain fields provide for the ability to confine and control electron trajectories within the strain regions,
with the manifestation of "snake-states" confined to regions of alternating pseudo-magnetic fields characterised by semi-classical
cyclotron orbits. Certain strain regimes can be classified synonymously as "nano-wires" characterised by quantum conductance.
Conclusively, the addition of strain induced PMFs subsequently induces the breaking of the local sub-lattice symmetry through
the redistribution of the local density of states. This property implies for the existence of polarizable currents characterised by
their valley indices"
